networking wrapper class that establishes UDP connection
then make network class able to send objects that are serialised
convert force/fire_shot into Action object that can be sent
will then have basic setup where can send from server to client etc dumb?
need to implement proper protocol on top of this as by gaffer, ie. resending redundant shit, buffering send/received, packet order ID's, etc

plan for now
