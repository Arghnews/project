    Looks nice

Date:   Fri Nov 25 17:49:10 2016 +0000

    Need to figure out how to render many things etc, get a better way to translate between worldly "Thing" objects and the actual vertices to render stuff

Date:   Fri Nov 25 16:32:59 2016 +0000

    Renamed method to move object, as that iss what it is, now going to think what next, maybe render several things?

Date:   Fri Nov 25 16:21:35 2016 +0000

    Changed camera name to instance string const, moved divide times by 10 into physics class

Date:   Fri Nov 25 16:04:53 2016 +0000

    Think have cracked simple physics for now, linear decel easier, multiplied by dt to be consistent across timesteps

Date:   Fri Nov 25 14:06:16 2016 +0000

    Need to normalize result of sideways motion vector crossed with up vector, else when object is tilted will move sideways slower, still cannot move up/down, need to investigate that next

Date:   Fri Nov 25 12:50:55 2016 +0000

    Just got it working, if you change things like the time delta passed in it rockets off, so still need looking at

Date:   Fri Nov 25 10:55:42 2016 +0000

    Need to tweak force parameters, currently shoot off, maybe in wrong dir etc got to find out

Date:   Fri Nov 25 09:44:39 2016 +0000

    Need to add vector of force vectors to each thing so that the physics method that resolves the forces on an object can take them all

Date:   Fri Nov 25 08:01:24 2016 +0000

    Integrated physics snazzy I believe, need to do more testing, hugh tesselation support seems pooped

Date:   Fri Nov 25 05:51:34 2016 +0000

    Dont normalize lookingAt when making camera, and changed physics to work with things rather than abstract states, now going to move physics code to master while loop

Date:   Fri Nov 25 05:16:20 2016 +0000

    Updated things to have a camera inside instead, cleaned up classes a bit, still yet to integrate physics, should make changing lookingAt vector a method on class so can also normalize every time

Date:   Fri Nov 25 03:38:14 2016 +0000

    About to integrate stuffz

Date:   Fri Nov 25 02:54:57 2016 +0000

    Changed input to take object (camera) name to move, about to integrate physics class into my objects

Date:   Thu Nov 24 12:40:50 2016 +0000

    About to go for lunch, need to integrate phys stuff

Date:   Thu Nov 24 12:20:46 2016 +0000

    Fixed swapchain recreate, due to pointer type change

Date:   Thu Nov 24 12:00:11 2016 +0000

    Moved stuff to input classes etc, working atm, now going to apply physics stuff to limit framerate

Date:   Thu Nov 24 08:35:30 2016 +0000

    Moved turnObject to be more implementation specific for subclasses, kept some of it for cursor outside at top level as need window dimensions though

Date:   Thu Nov 24 08:00:17 2016 +0000

    Done with floats, going to integrate physics into main loop

Date:   Thu Nov 24 07:11:18 2016 +0000

    About to change again, suspect float->doubles is issue

Date:   Thu Nov 24 06:51:48 2016 +0000

    About to switch to doubles, all good so far

Date:   Thu Nov 24 06:31:13 2016 +0000

    About to change to doubles and include Physics, this broke integrate branch before, this is good point

Date:   Thu Nov 24 04:18:17 2016 +0000

    Going to try and add Physics cpp into program main loop now

Date:   Thu Nov 24 04:01:40 2016 +0000

    Credit to Gaffer on Games, using his code as a basis for fps and tickrate, seems to work atm

Date:   Tue Nov 22 10:36:22 2016 +0000

    Think momentum/mass works, wooho!

Date:   Tue Nov 22 07:59:42 2016 +0000

    Going to try and convert this to incorporate mass

Date:   Tue Nov 22 07:09:18 2016 +0000

    About to turn from just velocity etc to momentum, ie add in mass

Date:   Tue Nov 22 05:02:44 2016 +0000

    Euler blows up quick, got basic air resist with rk4

Date:   Tue Nov 22 04:39:20 2016 +0000

    Testing out physics from gaffer on games

Date:   Sat Nov 19 14:08:31 2016 +0000

    Now about to figure out how to render multiple seperate things

Date:   Sat Nov 19 13:58:19 2016 +0000

    Mostly decoupled physics, still need to take a look at frame times if slip behind

Date:   Sat Nov 19 13:30:16 2016 +0000

    Splitting up still to physics etc, using virtual func seems messy but dont think I have a choice save a cast when getting derived or top level items from a map

Date:   Sat Nov 19 09:08:00 2016 +0000

    Moved physics sort of to another class, still need to complete move

Date:   Sat Nov 19 07:40:36 2016 +0000

    Decoupled timekeeping and a helper file, changed not_make_but_make_file to include all header dependencies

Date:   Sat Nov 19 05:26:22 2016 +0000

    Big rework, framerate and tickrate decoupled, main loop using an if to decide which to do, may need tweaking, no more delta, implemented airres/friction (fancy names) but basically just decel proportional to velocity and to square of it, stops sliding at low speeds

Date:   Fri Nov 18 23:28:52 2016 +0000

    Velocity etc works atm with different framerates, this is with decel constant as 0, I suspect this is the problem and will investigate this next

Date:   Fri Nov 18 22:05:08 2016 +0000

    Believed to have fixed physics with square decel independent of framerate, see notes file, about to add mass

Date:   Thu Nov 17 23:54:17 2016 +0000

    Changed movement to use accel, eg. for movement in x, x -= xSpeed*xSpeed*worldDecelv.x * decelConst

Date:   Thu Nov 17 21:18:02 2016 +0000

    Fixed god damn problem, was vsync

Date:   Thu Nov 17 19:41:02 2016 +0000

    Saved in broken state, going to test timing

Date:   Thu Nov 17 18:25:27 2016 +0000

    Currently broken above 60fps

Date:   Thu Nov 17 14:05:24 2016 +0000

    Added destroying of debug callback on close for clean closing

Date:   Wed Nov 16 21:02:43 2016 +0000

    Camera and mouse fixed to be independent of framerate

    vim relative lines

Date:   Wed Nov 16 16:55:52 2016 +0000

    Better camera, limits angles, added in delta frametime, need to use this in velocities etc

Date:   Wed Nov 16 12:15:52 2016 +0000

    Going for lunch

Date:   Wed Nov 16 07:57:53 2016 +0000

    Added shift to whiz about, added remove executable to bash script

    Smoother camera using very simple velocity idea

Date:   Wed Nov 16 06:37:59 2016 +0000

    Added speed modifiers and up/down movement

Date:   Wed Nov 16 06:06:13 2016 +0000

    Made better, will only do what it needs, ie. will not link if compile error

Date:   Wed Nov 16 05:27:59 2016 +0000

    Makescriptthing added clean function(yes it it still bad) and mouse camera working nicely

Date:   Wed Nov 16 03:25:12 2016 +0000

    Two spinning squares, removed texture stuff

    Now actual start point to add movement etc

Date:   Wed Nov 16 03:08:34 2016 +0000

    Moved from all vars static (oops) to members

Date:   Wed Nov 16 02:37:05 2016 +0000

    Made if header for cpp file exists and changed recompile, fixed typo

Date:   Wed Nov 16 02:32:11 2016 +0000
