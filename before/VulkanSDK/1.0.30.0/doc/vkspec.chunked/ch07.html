dependencies between the subpasses, and describes how the attachments are
used over the course of the subpasses.
The use of a render pass in a command buffer is a <span class="emphasis"><em>render pass instance</em></span>.</p><p>Render passes are represented by <code class="code">VkRenderPass</code> handles:</p><p><a id="VkRenderPass"></a><strong> </strong>
</p><pre class="programlisting">VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkRenderPass)</pre><p>
</p><p>An <span class="emphasis"><em>attachment description</em></span> describes the properties of an attachment
including its format, sample count, and how its contents are treated at the
beginning and end of each render pass instance.</p><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>subpass</em></span> represents a phase of rendering that reads and writes a subset
of the attachments in a render pass.
Rendering commands are recorded into a particular subpass of a render pass
instance.</p><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>subpass description</em></span> describes the subset of attachments that is involved
in the execution of a subpass.
Each subpass <span class="normative">can</span> read from some attachments as <span class="emphasis"><em>input attachments</em></span>, write
to some as <span class="emphasis"><em>color attachments</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>depth/stencil attachments</em></span>, and do
resolve operations to others as <span class="emphasis"><em>resolve attachments</em></span>.
A subpass description <span class="normative">can</span> also include a set of <span class="emphasis"><em>preserve attachments</em></span>,
which are attachments that are not read or written by the subpass but whose
contents <span class="normative">must</span> be preserved throughout the subpass.</p><p>A subpass <span class="emphasis"><em>uses</em></span> an attachment if the attachment is a color, depth/stencil,
resolve, or input attachment for that subpass.
A subpass does not use an attachment if that attachment is preserved by the
subpass.
The first use of an attachment is in the lowest numbered subpass that uses
that attachment.
Similarly, the last use of an attachment is in the highest numbered subpass
that uses that attachment.</p><p>The subpasses in a render pass all render to the same dimensions, and
fragments for pixel (x,y,layer) in one subpass <span class="normative">can</span> only read attachment
contents written by previous subpasses at that same (x,y,layer) location.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><table border="0" summary="Note: Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/icons/note.png" /></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>By describing a complete set of subpasses in advance, render passes provide
the implementation an opportunity to optimize the storage and transfer of
attachment data between subpasses.</p><p>In practice, this means that subpasses with a simple framebuffer-space
dependency <span class="normative">may</span> be merged into a single tiled rendering pass, keeping the
attachment data on-chip for the duration of a render pass instance.
However, it is also quite common for a render pass to only contain a single
subpass.</p></td></tr></table></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Subpass dependencies</em></span> describe ordering restrictions between pairs of
subpasses.
If no dependencies are specified, implementations <span class="normative">may</span> reorder or overlap
portions (e.g., certain shader stages) of the execution of subpasses.
Dependencies limit the extent of overlap or reordering, and are defined
using masks of pipeline stages and memory access types.
Each dependency acts as an
<a class="link" href="ch06s04.html" title="6.4. Execution And Memory Dependencies">execution and memory dependency</a>, similarly to how <a class="link" href="ch06s05.html" title="6.5. Pipeline Barriers">pipeline barriers</a> are defined.
Dependencies are needed if two subpasses operate on attachments with
overlapping ranges of the same <code class="code">VkDeviceMemory</code> object and at least one
subpass writes to that range.</p><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>subpass dependency chain</em></span> is a sequence of subpass dependencies in a
render pass, where the source subpass of each subpass dependency (after the
first) equals the destination subpass of the previous dependency.</p><p>A render pass describes the structure of subpasses and attachments
independent of any specific image views for the attachments.
The specific image views that will be used for the attachments, and their
dimensions, are specified in <code class="code">VkFramebuffer</code> objects.
Framebuffers are created with respect to a specific render pass that the
framebuffer is compatible with (see <a class="link" href="ch07s02.html" title="7.2. Render Pass Compatibility">Render Pass Compatibility</a>).
Collectively, a render pass and a framebuffer define the complete render
target state for one or more subpasses as well as the algorithmic
dependencies between the subpasses.</p><p>The various pipeline stages of the drawing commands for a given subpass <span class="normative">may</span>
execute concurrently and/or out of order, both within and across drawing
commands.
However for a given (x,y,layer,sample) sample location, certain per-sample
operations are performed in <a class="link" href="ch24s02.html" title="24.2. Rasterization Order">rasterization order</a>.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch06s06.html"><img src="images/icons/prev.png" alt="Prev" /></a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch07s01.html"><img src="images/icons/next.png" alt="Next" /></a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html"><img src="images/icons/home.png" alt="Home" /></a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
