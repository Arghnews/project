triangle is subdivided into a collection of triangles covering the area of
the original triangle.
First, the original triangle is subdivided into a collection of concentric
equilateral triangles.
The edges of each of these triangles are subdivided, and the area between
each triangle pair is filled by triangles produced by joining the vertices
on the subdivided edges.
The number of concentric triangles and the number of subdivisions along each
triangle except the outermost is derived from the first inner tessellation
level.
The edges of the outermost triangle are subdivided independently, using the
first, second, and third outer tessellation levels to control the number of
subdivisions of the <span class="eq">u = 0</span> (left), <span class="eq">v = 0</span> (bottom), and <span class="eq">w =
0</span> (right) edges, respectively.
The second inner tessellation level and the fourth outer tessellation level
have no effect in this mode.</p><p>If the first inner tessellation level and all three outer tessellation
levels are exactly one after clamping and rounding, only a single triangle
with <span class="eq">(u,v,w)</span> coordinates of <span class="eq">(0,0,1)</span>, <span class="eq">(1,0,0)</span>, and
<span class="eq">(0,1,0)</span> is generated.
If the inner tessellation level is one and any of the outer tessellation
levels is greater than one, the inner tessellation level is treated as
though it were originally specified as <span class="eq">1 + ε</span> and will result
in a two- or three-segment subdivision depending on the tessellation
spacing.
When used with fractional odd spacing, the three-segment subdivision <span class="normative">may</span>
produce <span class="emphasis"><em>inner vertices</em></span> positioned on the edge of the triangle.</p><p>If any tessellation level is greater than one, tessellation begins by
producing a set of concentric inner triangles and subdividing their edges.
First, the three outer edges are temporarily subdivided using the clamped
and rounded first inner tessellation level and the specified tessellation
spacing, generating <span class="eq">n</span> segments.
For the outermost inner triangle, the inner triangle is degenerate — a
single point at the center of the triangle — if <span class="eq">n</span> is two.
Otherwise, for each corner of the outer triangle, an inner triangle corner
is produced at the intersection of two lines extended perpendicular to the
corner’s two adjacent edges running through the vertex of the subdivided
outer edge nearest that corner.
If <span class="eq">n</span> is three, the edges of the inner triangle are not subdivided and
is the final triangle in the set of concentric triangles.
Otherwise, each edge of the inner triangle is divided into <span class="eq">n - 2</span>
segments, with the <span class="eq">n - 1</span> vertices of this subdivision produced by
intersecting the inner edge with lines perpendicular to the edge running
through the <span class="eq">n - 1</span> innermost vertices of the subdivision of the outer
edge.
Once the outermost inner triangle is subdivided, the previous subdivision
process repeats itself, using the generated triangle as an outer triangle.
This subdivision process is illustrated in <a class="link" href="ch21s04.html#img-innertri" title="Figure 21.2. Inner Triangle Tessellation">Inner Triangle Tessellation</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="img-innertri"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 21.2. Inner Triangle Tessellation</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/innertri.svg" align="middle" width="800" alt="images/innertri.svg" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Caption</strong></p></div></div></div><p>In the <a class="link" href="ch21s04.html#img-innertri" title="Figure 21.2. Inner Triangle Tessellation">Inner Triangle Tessellation</a> diagram, inner
tessellation levels of (a) five and (b) four are shown (not to scale).
Solid black circles depict vertices along the edges of the concentric
triangles.
The edges of inner triangles are subdivided by intersecting the edge with
segments perpendicular to the edge passing through each inner vertex of the
subdivided outer edge.
Dotted lines depict edges connecting corresponding vertices on the inner and
outer triangle edges.</p></div><p>Once all the concentric triangles are produced and their edges are
subdivided, the area between each pair of adjacent inner triangles is filled
completely with a set of non-overlapping triangles.
In this subdivision, two of the three vertices of each triangle are taken
from adjacent vertices on a subdivided edge of one triangle; the third is
one of the vertices on the corresponding edge of the other triangle.
If the innermost triangle is degenerate (i.e., a point), the triangle
containing it is subdivided into six triangles by connecting each of the six
vertices on that triangle with the center point.
If the innermost triangle is not degenerate, that triangle is added to the
set of generated triangles as-is.</p><p>After the area corresponding to any inner triangles is filled, the
tessellator generates triangles to cover the area between the outermost
triangle and the outermost inner triangle.
To do this, the temporary subdivision of the outer triangle edge above is
discarded.
Instead, the <span class="eq">u = 0</span>, <span class="eq">v = 0</span>, and <span class="eq">w = 0</span> edges are subdivided
according to the first, second, and third outer tessellation levels,
respectively, and the tessellation spacing.
The original subdivision of the first inner triangle is retained.
The area between the outer and first inner triangles is completely filled by
non-overlapping triangles as described above.
If the first (and only) inner triangle is degenerate, a set of triangles is
produced by connecting each vertex on the outer triangle edges with the
center point.</p><p>After all triangles are generated, each vertex in the subdivided triangle is
assigned a barycentric (u,v,w) coordinate based on its location relative to
the three vertices of the outer triangle.</p><p>The algorithm used to subdivide the triangular domain in (u,v,w) space into
individual triangles is implementation-dependent.
However, the set of triangles produced will completely cover the domain, and
no portion of the domain will be covered by multiple triangles.
The order in which the generated triangles passed to subsequent pipeline
stages and the order of the vertices in those triangles are both
implementation-dependent.
However, when depicted in a manner similar to <a class="link" href="ch21s04.html#img-innertri" title="Figure 21.2. Inner Triangle Tessellation">Inner Triangle Tessellation</a>, the order of the vertices in the generated triangles will be
either all clockwise or all counter-clockwise, according to the vertex order
layout declaration.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch21s03.html"><img src="images/icons/prev.png" alt="Prev" /></a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch21.html"><img src="images/icons/up.png" alt="Up" /></a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch21s05.html"><img src="images/icons/next.png" alt="Next" /></a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html"><img src="images/icons/home.png" alt="Home" /></a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
