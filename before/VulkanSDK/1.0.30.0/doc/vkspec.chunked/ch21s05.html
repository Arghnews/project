into a collection of triangles covering the area of the original rectangle.
First, the original rectangle is subdivided into a regular mesh of
rectangles, where the number of rectangles along the <span class="eq">u = 0</span> and <span class="eq">u
= 1</span> (vertical) and <span class="eq">v = 0</span> and <span class="eq">v = 1</span> (horizontal) edges are
derived from the first and second inner tessellation levels, respectively.
All rectangles, except those adjacent to one of the outer rectangle edges,
are decomposed into triangle pairs.
The outermost rectangle edges are subdivided independently, using the first,
second, third, and fourth outer tessellation levels to control the number of
subdivisions of the <span class="eq">u = 0</span> (left), <span class="eq">v = 0</span> (bottom), <span class="eq">u = 1</span>
(right), and <span class="eq">v = 1</span> (top) edges, respectively.
The area between the inner rectangles of the mesh and the outer rectangle
edges are filled by triangles produced by joining the vertices on the
subdivided outer edges to the vertices on the edge of the inner rectangle
mesh.</p><p>If both clamped inner tessellation levels and all four clamped outer
tessellation levels are exactly one, only a single triangle pair covering
the outer rectangle is generated.
Otherwise, if either clamped inner tessellation level is one, that
tessellation level is treated as though it were originally specified as
<span class="eq">1 + ε</span> and will result in a two- or three-segment subdivision
depending on the tessellation spacing.
When used with fractional odd spacing, the three-segment subdivision <span class="normative">may</span>
produce <span class="emphasis"><em>inner vertices</em></span> positioned on the edge of the rectangle.</p><p>If any tessellation level is greater than one, tessellation begins by
subdividing the <span class="eq">u = 0</span> and <span class="eq">u = 1</span> edges of the outer rectangle
into <span class="eq">m</span> segments using the clamped and rounded first inner tessellation
level and the tessellation spacing.
The <span class="eq">v = 0</span> and <span class="eq">v = 1</span> edges are subdivided into <span class="eq">n</span> segments
using the second inner tessellation level.
Each vertex on the <span class="eq">u = 0</span> and <span class="eq">v = 0</span> edges are joined with the
corresponding vertex on the <span class="eq">u = 1</span> and <span class="eq">v = 1</span> edges to produce a
set of vertical and horizontal lines that divide the rectangle into a grid
of smaller rectangles.
The primitive generator emits a pair of non-overlapping triangles covering
each such rectangle not adjacent to an edge of the outer rectangle.
The boundary of the region covered by these triangles forms an inner
rectangle, the edges of which are subdivided by the grid vertices that lie
on the edge.
If either <span class="eq">m</span> or <span class="eq">n</span> is two, the inner rectangle is degenerate, and
one or both of the rectangle’s <span class="emphasis"><em>edges</em></span> consist of a single point.
This subdivision is illustrated in Figure <a class="link" href="ch21s05.html#img-innerquad" title="Figure 21.3. Inner Quad Tessellation">Inner Quad Tessellation</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="img-innerquad"></a><p class="title"><strong>Figure 21.3. Inner Quad Tessellation</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/innerquad.svg" align="middle" width="800" alt="images/innerquad.svg" /></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" /><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Caption</strong></p></div></div></div><p>In the <a class="link" href="ch21s05.html#img-innerquad" title="Figure 21.3. Inner Quad Tessellation">Inner Quad Tessellation</a> diagram, inner quad
tessellation levels of (a) <span class="eq">(4,2)</span> and (b) <span class="eq">(7,4)</span> are shown.
Gray regions in figure (b) depict the 10 inner rectangles, each of which
will be subdivided into two triangles.
Solid black circles depict vertices on the boundary of the outer and inner
rectangles, where the inner rectangle on the top figure is degenerate (a
single line segment).
Dotted lines depict the horizontal and vertical edges connecting
corresponding vertices on the inner and outer rectangle edges.</p></div><p>After the area corresponding to the inner rectangle is filled, the
tessellator <span class="normative">must</span> produce triangles to cover the area between the inner and
outer rectangles.
To do this, the subdivision of the outer rectangle edge above is discarded.
Instead, the <span class="eq">u = 0</span>, <span class="eq">v = 0</span>, <span class="eq">u = 1</span>, and <span class="eq">v = 1</span> edges
are subdivided according to the first, second, third, and fourth outer
tessellation levels, respectively, and the tessellation spacing.
The original subdivision of the inner rectangle is retained.
The area between the outer and inner rectangles is completely filled by
non-overlapping triangles.
Two of the three vertices of each triangle are adjacent vertices on a
subdivided edge of one rectangle; the third is one of the vertices on the
corresponding edge of the other triangle.
If either edge of the innermost rectangle is degenerate, the area near the
corresponding outer edges is filled by connecting each vertex on the outer
edge with the single vertex making up the <span class="emphasis"><em>inner edge</em></span>.</p><p>The algorithm used to subdivide the rectangular domain in (u,v) space into
individual triangles is implementation-dependent.
However, the set of triangles produced will completely cover the domain, and
no portion of the domain will be covered by multiple triangles.
The order in which the generated triangles passed to subsequent pipeline
stages and the order of the vertices in those triangles are both
implementation-dependent.
However, when depicted in a manner similar to <a class="link" href="ch21s05.html#img-innerquad" title="Figure 21.3. Inner Quad Tessellation">Inner Quad Tessellation</a>, the order of the vertices in the generated triangles will be
either all clockwise or all counter-clockwise, according to the vertex order
layout declaration.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch21s04.html"><img src="images/icons/prev.png" alt="Prev" /></a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch21.html"><img src="images/icons/up.png" alt="Up" /></a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch21s06.html"><img src="images/icons/next.png" alt="Next" /></a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html"><img src="images/icons/home.png" alt="Home" /></a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
