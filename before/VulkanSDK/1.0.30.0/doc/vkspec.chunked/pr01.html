parts of the Specification are marked by the “Note” icon or designated “Informative”.</p><p>Where this Specification uses terms, defined in the Glossary or otherwise, that refer to
enabling technologies that are not expressly set forth as being required for compliance,
those enabling technologies are outside the Scope of this Specification.</p><p>Where this Specification uses the terms “may”, or “optional”, such features or
behaviors do not define requirements necessary for compliance and so are outside the
