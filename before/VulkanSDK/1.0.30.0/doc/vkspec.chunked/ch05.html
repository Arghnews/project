subsequently submitted to a device queue for execution.
There are two levels of command buffers - <span class="emphasis"><em>primary command buffers</em></span>, which
<span class="normative">can</span> execute secondary command buffers, and which are submitted to queues,
and <span class="emphasis"><em>secondary command buffers</em></span>, which <span class="normative">can</span> be executed by primary command
buffers, and which are not directly submitted to queues.</p><p>Command buffers are represented by <code class="code">VkCommandBuffer</code> handles:</p><p><a id="VkCommandBuffer"></a><strong> </strong>
</p><pre class="programlisting">VK_DEFINE_HANDLE(VkCommandBuffer)</pre><p>
</p><p>Recorded commands include commands to bind pipelines and descriptor sets to
the command buffer, commands to modify dynamic state, commands to draw (for
graphics rendering), commands to dispatch (for compute), commands to execute
secondary command buffers (for primary command buffers only), commands to
copy buffers and images, and other commands.</p><p><a id="commandbuffers-statereset"></a>Each command buffer manages state independently of other command buffers.
There is no inheritance of state across primary and secondary command
buffers, or between secondary command buffers.
When a command buffer begins recording, all state in that command buffer is
undefined.
When secondary command buffer(s) are recorded to execute on a primary
command buffer, the secondary command buffer inherits no state from the
primary command buffer, and all state of the primary command buffer is
undefined after an execute secondary command buffer command is recorded.
There is one exception to this rule - if the primary command buffer is
inside a render pass instance, then the render pass and subpass state is not
disturbed by executing secondary command buffers.
Whenever the state of a command buffer is undefined, the application <span class="normative">must</span>
set all relevant state on the command buffer before any state dependent
commands such as draws and dispatches are recorded, otherwise the behavior
of executing that command buffer is undefined.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, and without explicit synchronization, the
various commands submitted to a queue via command buffers <span class="normative">may</span> execute in
arbitrary order relative to each other, and/or concurrently.
Also, the memory side-effects of those commands <span class="normative">may</span> not be directly visible
to other commands without memory barriers.
This is true within a command buffer, and across command buffers submitted
to a given queue.
